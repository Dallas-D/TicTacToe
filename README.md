# TicTacToe-in-BATCH
Where I make the game TicTacToe in Batch, simply because I can.

The TicTacToe.bat file is the official game file. It contains the most recent version of the game. The additional files are where I test certain parts of batch code (since it is a pain to work with). tictactoeBASIC.bat is my original version of the game, altough it is not pretty and creates extra files to store game data.
